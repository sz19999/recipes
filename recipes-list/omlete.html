    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I'm sure you know how to make an Omelette, perhaps better than mine even.
        However, maybe you forgot how to make one. So here's a quick recipe on how to make an easy,
        tasty Omelette in 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt (Optional: Other spices, e.g. Pepper)</li>
        <li>Milk (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab 2/3 eggs, Break them in a bowl of your choice.</li>
        <li>Add some spices you like, I usually add some salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add a little milk, if you wish. It gives a puffiness.</li>
        <li>Whisk everything with a fork until it has a uniform clean look.</li>
        <li>Put a pan on the stove, let it sit and warm up a little, and then pour the mixture.</li>
        <li>Let it cook a bit, then flip it. Cook it until it becomes solid, but don't overcook it. 
            If you do, it becomes too dry.
        </li>
        <li>That's it, you did it! Now throw your masterpiece Omelette on a plate. Add some leaves above, 
            perhaps cut some vegetables and put it aside. Feel free to use your imagination, have fun! and 
            of course bon appetite!
        </li>
    </ol>
