    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I'm sure you know how to make an Omlete, perhaps better than mine even.
        However, maybe you forgot how to make one. So here's a quick recipe on how to make an easy,
        perhaps tasty Omlete in 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab 2/3 eggs, Break them in a bowl of your choice.</li>
        <li>Add some spices you like, I usually add some salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add a little milk, if you wish. It gives a puffiness.</li>
        <li>Whisk everything with a fork untill it has a uniform clean look.</li>
        <li>Put a pan on the stove, let it sit and warm up a little, and then pour the mixture.</li>
        <li>Let it cook a bit, then flip it. Cook it untill it becomes solid, but dont overcook it. 
            If you do, it becomes too dry.
        </li>
        <li>That's it, you did it! Now throw the your masterpiece Omlete on a plate. Add some leaves above, 
            perhaps cut some vegtables and put it aside. Feel free to use your imagination, have fun! and 
            ofcourse bon apetite!
        </li>
    </ol>
